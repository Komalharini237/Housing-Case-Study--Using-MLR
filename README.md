# Housing-Case-Study--Using-MLR

- You will first read and visualise your dataset and then prepare your data for building a linear model.
- This will include dealing with categorical variables, adding dummy variables, and scaling.
- You will then start building the model with a bottom-up approach, i.e., you will start with one variable and keep on adding more. 
- Once all the variables have been added, you will perform a manual feature elimination and move on to the residual analysis and predictions, as usual.
- To furthur the analysis, you can solve the same problem using RFE (in another project).

## Problem Statement:

Consider that a real estate company has the data of real-estate prices in Delhi. The company wants to optimise the selling price of the properties, based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.

Essentially, the company wants:

- To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g., area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
- To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables, such as the number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well do these variables predict the house prices


Steps:

1. Reading, understanding and visualizing the data
2. Preparing the data for modelling (train-test plit, rescalling, etc.)
3. Training the model
4. Residual Analysis
5. Predictions and evaluation on the test set
