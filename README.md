# Housing-Case-Study--Using-MLR

- You will first read and visualise your dataset and then prepare your data for building a linear model.
- This will include dealing with categorical variables, adding dummy variables, and scaling.
- You will then start building the model with a bottom-up approach, i.e., you will start with one variable and keep on adding more. 
- Once all the variables have been added, you will perform a manual feature elimination and move on to the residual analysis and predictions, as usual.
- To furthur the analysis, you can solve the same problem using RFE (in another project).
